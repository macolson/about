    <p class="font-sans text-xs text-gray-700 tracking-wide leading-loose">

        I´m Oliver but most people call me <em>Olli</em>. My first small projects with PHP started more than 10 years ago.
        In the past few years I started focusing on the Laravel PHP framework and VueJS for daily coding.
        When I´m not sitting in front of my MacBook I enjoy life with my two sons and my wife in the beautiful Zillertaler Mountains.
        While commuting to work I enjoy listening to tech Podcasts and other fun to listen Podcast formats.
