        Hey there! My name is Oliver, but most people call me <em>Olli</em>.<br>
        I’m a bit of a geek when it comes to coding and technical gadgets.
        Already ten years ago I started with first, small projects, at that time coding with PHP.
        In the last couple of years, I started focusing on the Laravel PHP framework and VueJS for daily coding and all
        of this basically as self-study.
        As I´m following some Laravel Devs on twitter, every day I see stuff I want to implement and learn to write
        faster more stable and shorter code.
        <br>When I'm not sitting in front of my MacBook I enjoy life with my two boys and my wife in the beautiful
        Zillertaler Mountains.
        We go hiking, biking, skiing, climbing, all the good stuff!
        On my way to work I use my time to listen to tech-podcasts - my top three are Apfelfunk (Focus on Apple related
        news), Laravel News (Laravel PHP Framework news and updates), Freakshow (<em>Leben mit Technik im 21.
            Jahrhundert</em>)
